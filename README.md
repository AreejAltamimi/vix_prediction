The goal of this project is to predict stock market volitility as an indicator of economic risk using various regression techniques.  

The business reasoning is that if you can predict viotility you can understand risk and run your stock portfolilo (or business) with the right degree of risk.

The 1st version of the project will examine the historic CBOE VIX index of volitility and try and precict it based on various variables. The first will be the Federal Prime Interest Rate.
