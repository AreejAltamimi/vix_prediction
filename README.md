## Project VIX

The goal of this project is to predict stock market volitility (as calculated by the VIX) as an indicator of economic risk using various regression techniques.  

The business reasoning is that if you can predict market viotility you can understand risk and run your stock portfolilo (or business) with the right degree of risk.

This time series analysis shows how to use many different techniques including autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation to get a good guess for ARIMA/SARIMAX parameters and using computational power to try and find the optimal parameters. I also tried Facebook Prophet which has nice graphs built in that help explain your data.  

At the end of the project I concluded that predicting market volitility is challenging (as expected). In picking a great challenging project though I learned a lot of techniques I could apply to more typical time series analysis like forecasting sales and other business data.

To learn more please read the Jupyter notebooks where I cover EDA, optimizing ARIMA models, SARIMAX models and my Facebook Prophet test.
