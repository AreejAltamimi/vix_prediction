The goal of my project is to predict the VIX using time series analysis and
exogenous variables (I'm starting with the Federal Prime Rate history).

My first goal is to test all of the models we've learned in class, I'm calling
this my MVP. I completed that in a Jupyter Notebook with an RMSE of 5.2
using ARIMA (really just AR). The graph looked bad though so I'm not satisfied.

I also tried a SARIMAX model with my exogenous variable, but the RMSE was worse at
21.7.

My next goal will be to attempt the same things (simple time series, then with
exogenous variables) using Facebook Prophet. Prophet had a RMSE of 9.

After that I have a few more ideas:
- Change data to % change instead of raw VIX values. Could also try this for prime Rate
- Find an exogenous variable with more data
- Take my learnings and stress test them on class data to see if I'm missing something
- Change my problem to something easier to predict than stock market data?
- Dive deeper into how VIX is calculated to see if I'm aggregating some stupid way
- Read more tutorials?
